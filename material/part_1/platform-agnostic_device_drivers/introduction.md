# Platform agnostic drivers

Writing a driver that works for you is one thing.

Writing a portable driver is something else.

In this part of the workshop we are going to be looking at driver design in C and in Rust. This entails
the hardware interaction and low level definitions.

High level drivers aren't covered much because it's harder to generalize about those due to the vast differences
two devices can have.
