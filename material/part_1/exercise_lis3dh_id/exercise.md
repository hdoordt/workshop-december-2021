# Exercise: LIS3DH ID

We've covered a lot of topics already, so let's go back and try to make something ourselves.

To get started we'll setup the i2c on our development kit and read out the ID register of the LIS3DH accelerometer.
The starting point can be found in `assignments/part_1` of this repository.

Depending on your development kit, there are some steps to take.
If you have the nRF52840-DK, then you're good to go.
If you have the nRF52832-DK, then we have some things to change.
