# Part 1: Overview and drivers

This first part will give an overview of how the Rust Embedded ecosystem is built up.

We'll then use our newly gained knowledge to get our first application running and read out the ID of the LIS3DH accelerometer.

When you really want to use a device, you want to have a driver. We are going to learn about those next.

To finish off, there's a last exercise where we actually create a (start of a) driver.
