# Part 2: Rust in IoT
The second part is about using Rust in a larger project. A nice framework to develop larger firmware applications in, is RTIC. RTIC will be introduced in the first part of this course. In the first exercise, you'll write your first RTIC application.

In IoT, you'll typically do some communication with a customly optimized format. The second part revolves around communication between a host and a device using shared code. 
The second exercise is about sending commands and data between device and host, and handling incoming messages.
