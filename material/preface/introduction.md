# Introduction
Hello and welcome to Tweede golf's Embedded Rust Workshop! In this workshop, we'll get you started on writing your own embedded software using Rust.

The workshop is divided into two separate parts. Each part starts with us talking you through the material, introducing some concepts you'll need in order to complete an assignment. Of course, we'll be available for any questions and pointers and will.

Take a look at the [curriculum](/preface/curriculum.md) to get an idea of what's to come, and, please, before the workshop starts, [**follow the setup instructions**](/preface/setup.md).

The next sections of this site contain slide pages, which will be presented during the workshop sessions. They contain links to sources and other explanations, so be sure to use them as reference.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.
