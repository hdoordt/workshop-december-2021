# Course overview

## Part 1: Overview of the Rust embedded ecosystem + writing a platform-agnostic driver

## Part 2: A case for Rust: how to make Rust work for you in an IoT project
*Getting a feel of working with Rust is like in a larger project.*

### Learning outcomes
- Commonly used tools for setting up, building, debugging, testing and running Rust firmware
